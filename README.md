# Decentralized Specialized Disaster Recovery Housing

## Overview

This blockchain-based platform facilitates rapid, efficient, and transparent allocation of temporary housing resources during disaster recovery operations. By connecting property owners with displaced individuals through a decentralized system, the platform ensures equitable distribution of shelter resources, maintains privacy and dignity for disaster victims, and creates accountability throughout the recovery process.
